Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step1 -Wall -Werror -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step1.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the page type is wrong!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: 选择对应的页面未声明: Page 0
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the page number is not valid!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
The code did not compile!

Overall Grade: NO GRADE YET
