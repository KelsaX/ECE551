Doing some basic checking for your submission

Step 1
Checking that cyoa-step1 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step1' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step1 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 1
------------------------------------


1.1: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.2: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 /usr/local/ece551/cyoa/story2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Your output looks good. Lets check valgrind
Valgrind was clean


1.3: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error1 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the page type is wrong!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.4: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error2 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: 选择对应的页面未声明: Page 0
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.5: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error3 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the pageNUM is not valid in declaration line!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.6: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error4 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the page type is wrong in page.h!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.7: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error5 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: the pageNUM is not valid in declaration line!
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean


1.8: Current test is ./cyoa-step1 step1error6 < /dev/null
-----------------------------
Great: we both considered this an error
----here is what you printed on stderr---
Error: 页面声明顺序错误: 预期的页面编号是 10，但得到的是 11
-----------------------------------------
Lets check if it valgrinds:
Valgrind was clean
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 1

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
make: 'cyoa-step2' is up to date.
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step2 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 2
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 2

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
g++     cyoa-step3.cpp   -o cyoa-step3
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step3 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 3
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 3

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
g++ -o cyoa-step4 -Wall -Werror -std=gnu++98 cyoa-step4.cpp
The code compiled (good)
Executable cyoa-step4 exists (good)
------------------------------------
Now running YOUR tests for step 4
------------------------------------
No request to check for intermediate deadline completion on step 4

You have passed the test cases YOU provided
If your tests are good, this is great. 
If your tests are insufficient, you should do much more testing
